*In addition to the JDBC connectivity enabled to Databricks from the legend-engine itself, this project helps 
organizations define data models that can be converted into efficient data pipelines, ensuring data being queried 
is of high quality and availability. Raw data can be ingested as stream or batch and processed in line with the 
business semantics defined from the Legend interface. Domain specific language defined in Legend Studio can be 
interpreted as a series of Spark SQL operations, helping analysts create Delta Lake tables that not only guarantees 
schema definition but also complies with expectations, derivations and constraints defined by business analysts.*
